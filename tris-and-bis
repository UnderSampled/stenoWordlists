framed as
much a
since it
always lived
a set
as a
was not
not a
like red
find a

and yet
one way

at all
then these
should like
one vote
found out

we say

side and
us might
make such
such a
it has
it has
has all
all but
its own
own leg
now dead
pain it
was a
a bad
bad thing
we say
we mean
it was
was bad
and as
as it
came on
me at
did not
was not
pain was
at all
came and
and felt
at odds
shown as
us put
we had
had not
it did
we should
should say
as bad
a chance
and feel
then it
was bad
bad we
pain was
was bad

thus an
we use
we meant

it should
we mean

and hence
can see
one way
way out
